# MandelbrotProjects

This is a collection of the best mandelbrot programs I have created. They may not be amazing, as I made them in 2021, and have learned some new things recently. The Mandelbrot template maker produces templates that are saved in the directory that the file in run in, and are turned into photos using the TempReader, which asks for input colours and a template, like the 50001 x 50001 I have provided, and turns them into photos that are saved in the photos file. The Mandelbrot3 file just makes an image without making the template.
